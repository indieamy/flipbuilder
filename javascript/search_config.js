Caring is at the heart of building relationships with students. Geneva Gay (2000) noted that caring within a culturally responsive context automatically places teachers in a different kind of emotional and academic partnership with students. This relationship is anchored in af rmation, mutual respect, and validation that breed an unshakable belief that all students not only can, but will improve their school achievement. This activity allows educators to explore their experiences and beliefs about connecting with students.\nMaterials/Set-Up\n• None\nInstructional Steps\n• Introduce the concept of relational capacity with educators using the information from the Building Relational Capacity unit introduction on pages 2 and 3.\n• Ask educators to spend two or three minutes responding to the following quickwrite prompt: “In my classroom, school, etc., I build relationships with students by...”\n• Have educators form even-numbered groups of about six or more. Then, have each group form two lines, equal in number, with every individual facing a peer in the other line.\n• Read or display the  rst question below, and ask group members to share their responses with the partner they are facing:\n• How do you create a sense of trust and safety in your relationships with your students? Are you intentional or random?\n• How do you determine what makes your students feel safe and comfortable based on their perspectives and experiences?\n• How does the diversity present in the classroom in uence how you develop relationships with your students?\n• Do you know the areas in which your students excel or have expertise?\n• After a brief period of sharing between partners, ask the educators to share a second question with a different partner. Continue the process until all questions have been discussed.\n• Direct educators to return to their quickwrites and add to them by addressing the following prompt: “As a result of this re ective activity, I... (What will you continue to do? What could you do differently? What steps do you need to take to build relational capacity?)”\nExtension\n• To extend the learning, ask educators to consider working with a colleague to coach one another and to discuss ways to build effective relational capacity within a culturally responsive classroom.\n“No signi cant learning\noccurs without a\nsigni cant ”\nrelationship.\nJames Comer\nQuickwrite is a  uency activity where students write nonstop for two to  ve minutes on a speci c topic that they are studying. The purpose of focused writing is for students to  nd out what they know about a topic, to explore new ideas, and to  nd out what they need to learn about a topic.\nBuilding Relational Capacity: Transforming Educators 7\n","1.3\nCreating a Safe Learning Community\nEducator Objective\nEducators will create a school or classroom community that includes a safe and welcoming environment for all students.\nOverview\nThis activity allows educators to explore components critical to creating an environment conducive to a safe learning community and make connections to their current school or classroom environment.\nMaterials/Set-Up\n• Educator Resource:\n• 1.3a: Components of a Safe Learning Community\n• Chart paper and sticky notes\nInstructional Steps\n• Direct educators to sit in groups of four to six.\n• Ask them to silently brainstorm the components that should be present to establish a safe\nlearning community. As they brainstorm, have them write each idea on a separate sticky note.\n• When everyone in the group has  nished brainstorming, ask each member of the group to post their sticky notes on a designated piece of chart paper.\n• Once all of the sticky notes are posted, instruct the groups to continue to work silently as they group the sticky notes into overlapping ideas and common categories.\n• No talking is allowed until the group has successfully clustered all of their ideas.\n• Instruct groups that they may now verbally discuss labels for each category. Have them write\nthose labels above the clusters of sticky notes.\n• Then, have each group hang their chart paper on the wall and designate a spokesperson to share the group’s thoughts with the room.\n• Distribute the Components of a Safe Learning Community resource and have educators review the information individually.\n• In their groups, ask educators to review how the information on the resource compares to what their group had initially discussed.\n• This resource is not all inclusive, and should serve only as a guide for components of a safe learning community.\n• Groups may brainstorm additional valid components, which lends itself to the opportunity to deepen discussion about creating an environment that facilitates a safe learning community.\n• To close the activity, instruct educators to re ect on the following questions:\n• How would you characterize the level of safety that students feel in your school or\nclassroom?\n• What do you do to ensure that a safe learning community is in place?\n• What components do you believe are most critical in creating a safe environment for student learning?\n• What did you learn from this activity that you would like to incorporate into your school or classroom?\nExtension\n• To extend the learning, ask the educators to consider working with a colleague to dialogue about creating a safe learning community within a culturally relevant classroom.\nBuilding Relational Capacity: Transforming Educators 9\n","CHAPTER TWO\nBuilding Relational Capacity Empowering Students\nVisit the AVID Culturally Relevant Teaching webpage on MYAVID for additional materials and resources.\n29\n","2.1\nIcebreaker: Imaginative Nametag\nStudent Objective\nk-3 4-6\nStudents will establish themselves as individuals and develop interpersonal skills as they get to know their peers.\nOverview\nThis activity engages each student as an individual while establishing a positive, scholarly environment.\nMaterials/Set-Up\n• Student Handout:\n• 2.1a: Nametag\n• Hole punch\n• Markers and/or colored pencils • Yarn or thin ribbon\nInstructional Steps\n• Distribute a copy of the Nametag handout to each student. Have them print their names on the blank line at the top of the page.\n• Direct students to use markers or colored pencils to create a visual representation to answer each question in the  rst three boxes of the handout. In the fourth box, students will make a list of words that describe them.\n• Assist students with punching two small holes at the top of the handout.\n• Demonstrate how to string a piece of yarn or thin ribbon through the two\nholes and tie a knot.\n• Direct students to hang the nametag around their neck and mingle around the room,  nding someone who they do not know very well or at all.\n• Direct students to visually share their creative nametag with their partner.\n• Explain to students that they should then take turns telling each other what they think their partner’s nametag says about him or her. At this time, students should not interrupt each other if the partner is mistaken in their interpretation.\n• When both partners  nish sharing, allow students to talk and correct each other if needed.\nExtension\n• To increase scaffolding:\n• Elementary students may need examples of things that are “valued” to ensure that they understand how the term is being used in this context.\n• Elementary students and/or English language learners may bene t from a group brainstorming session to create a word bank for the fourth box.\n• Some students may need to see the partner exchange modeled to understand when they may and may not talk.\nBuilding Relational Capacity: Empowering Students 31\n","2.2\nIcebreaker: Diversity Bingo\nStudent Objective\nk-3 4-6\nStudents will gather knowledge of a topic through movement and communication.\nOverview\nIn Diversity Bingo, students move around the room to  nd other students who  t the categories on the Diversity Bingo Card. Although  ve spaces in a row is a traditional bingo, challenge your students to cover all of the squares on their card, getting to know as many of the students in the class as possible.\nMaterials/Set-Up\n• Student Handout:\n• 2.2a: Diversity Bingo Card\nor\n• 2.2b: Diversity Bingo Card for Elementary\n• Music (optional) Instructional Steps\n• Pass out one Diversity Bingo Card to each student.\n• Determine how much time students will have to mingle with their\nclassmates. Ten minutes is recommended.\n• Give students directions for the game:\n• Read the descriptions in each square.\n• Write your name in one square that describes you.\n• Move around the room and talk to your classmates.\n• Find someone who matches the description in one of the squares that remains un lled.\n• Then, write his/her name in the applicable square.\n• A person’s name may only be used once on the card.\n• Try to get as many boxes  lled as possible during the allotted time.\n• Music may be played to start and stop the activity, as upbeat music helps keep the movement  owing.\n• Debrief with the class:\n• Check to see how students did: How many students  lled in  ve boxes on their card? ...10? ...15? Did anyone  ll in all of the squares?\n• What are some things that you learned about your peers?\n• How are you connected or did you relate to your classmates’ experiences?\n• How do the diverse experiences in the room contribute and add value to our learning environment?\nBuilding Relational Capacity: Empowering Students 33\n","Extension\n• To increase rigor:\n• Create additional Diversity Bingo Cards related to content or vocabulary. Students must  nd others who can demonstrate their knowledge about what is in a square.\n• Create a Diversity Bingo Card with actions (e.g., “Can do three push-ups,” “Can whistle,” “Can rub their stomach and pat their head simultaneously,” “Can recite their 7 times tables”). Students must  nd someone in the room who can do the action by actually demonstrating it before signing off on their card.\n• To increase scaffolding, give students a blank Diversity Bingo Card and have them randomly write in names from a list of students in the class and/or people in the school community (e.g., nurse, counselor, music director, principal) and play a traditional game of bingo, calling names until someone has  ve in a row. This helps students learn the names of people who they will interact with at school.\n34 AVID Culturally Relevant Teaching: A Schoolwide Approach\n","k-3 4-6\n2.15\nCommunity Builder: Human Number Line\nStudent Objective\nStudents will analyze their skill level within an activity and communicate their justi cation for their decision.\nOverview\nParticipation in this activity allows students to see that no one is good at everything, but everyone is good at something. Teachers are also able to learn more about their students, and thus build better relationships. Peers learn more about each other, which contributes to creating a sense of community within the classroom. This activity is best used at the beginning of the school year to help break down barriers and build con dence in students, but may also be used during the school year with content skills.\nMaterials/Set-Up\n• A prepared number line along a wall in the classroom, with 11 marked-off, equal spaces (0–10)\nInstructional Steps\n• Explain to students that they will be creating a human number line, and ask for six to eight volunteers.\n• Tell volunteers that the number line represents a 0–10 scale, and that when a talent or skill is called out, they should place themselves where they feel they fall on the scale \[10 being really good (“I am an expert”), and 0 being not good at all (“I have never done this” or “I have tried this and don’t like it all”)\].\n• Tell volunteers that the  rst skill is swimming. Provide an example of what the numbers on the scale might represent.\n• 0 or 1 might be “I have never been swimming” or “I don’t like to swim, or I don’t want to try.”\n• 5 might be “I know enough to not drown” or “I can swim pretty well, but it’s not my favorite thing to do.”\n• 10 might be “I have had swimming lessons and like to swim,” “I am on a swim team,” “I worked as a lifeguard at the Y last summer,” or “I swim like a  sh.”\n• Once volunteers place themselves on the number line, have each one explain why they chose that number.\n52\nAVID Culturally Relevant Teaching: A Schoolwide Approach\n","• Tell volunteers that the next skill is cooking and have them move to their level of expertise for that skill. Again, provide examples for students of what the numbers on the scale may represent.\n• 0 or 1 might be “I don’t know how to use the microwave, let alone the oven.”\n• 5 might be “I can follow directions on the box and make macaroni and cheese.”\n• 10 might be “I cook for my family, and they think my food is delicious.”\n• Again, have each volunteer explain why they chose that number.\n• Ask the rest of the students what they just observed:\n• Did everyone stay in the same place for both skills?\n• Were some people really good at one thing and not so good at the other?\n• What does that tell us?\n• What reasons did you hear from people who placed themselves at the high end? At the low end? (Be sure students understand the roles that passion, opportunity, motivation, talent, effort, and/or experience may have played.)\n• Continue for as many rounds as time allows. Ask other volunteers to rotate through. All students may not get to participate in one session, so provide additional opportunities on another day.\n• Other skills to use may include: singing, dancing, drawing, chess, basketball, soccer, scouting, hiking, bike riding, writing, reading, public speaking, playing a musical instrument, leadership, or computer skills.\nExtension\n• To increase rigor, utilize the same process with content concepts and skills by having students assess their expertise with upcoming units of study (e.g., geometry, fractions, persuasive writing, poetry, chemistry, historical documents). This works well when students have a strong sense of community and are comfortable saying, “This is not my best area.”\n• To increase scaffolding, pre-assess, if needed, to ensure that all students understand the basics of a number line. If familiarity is low and students are unclear, provide background instructions. For younger students, the scale may need to be adjusted to 0–5.\nBuilding Relational Capacity: Empowering Students 53\n","CHAPTER THREE\nEmpowering Student Voice Transforming Educators\nVisit the AVID Culturally Relevant Teaching webpage on MYAVID for additional materials and resources.\n79\n","3.1\nFixed vs. Growth Mindset: Which One Are You?\nEducator Objective\nEducators will determine which attitudes they possess that re ect a  xed mindset and which re ect a growth mindset, and will work toward changing  xed-mindset attitudes into those of a growth mindset.\nOverview\nMindset plays an important role in becoming a culturally relevant educator. As a result, it’s important to examine the mindset that currently houses your attitudes. Have you ever stopped to re ect on how you view your students, their abilities, and their behaviors? What beliefs do you have about learning? This activity is designed to provide re ection time for personal and professional growth. It is important to remember that our mindsets can change based on situations and our environment at the time. As you participate in this activity, focus on your attitudes and reactions when faced with new learning or obstacles to achieving a goal.\nMaterials/Set-Up\n• Educator Resources:\n• 3.1a: Fixed vs. Growth Mindset • 3.1b: Changing My Mindset\nInstructional Steps\n• Have educators engage in re ective writing through responding to the following questions in order to focus their thinking:\n• Describe a time when you faced a challenge. How did you approach it?\n• Did you get it solved and/or achieve your goal the  rst time? If not, what did you do?\n• What led to either your success or failure with the challenge?\n• What was your motivation to succeed?\n• If you deemed the effort a failure, how did you handle it?\n• Then, have educators review the Fixed vs. Growth Mindset resource.\nAs they read about each attribute, instruct them to re ect on what they believe about learning and how they approach learning something that is new and challenging.\nEmpowering Student Voice: Transforming Educators 81\n","• After reviewing the chart, inform educators that they are to return to their re ective writing and respond to the following questions:\n• What mindset do you believe that you possess? Why?\n• Did you relate to beliefs or attributes on both sides?\n• Is there something on the Fixed Mindset side that you would like to change?\n• Finally, advise educators to use the Changing My Mindset resource to develop a plan of action for creating or strengthening their growth mindset.\nExtension\n• To extend the learning, have the activity culminate with a Socratic Seminar about  xed versus growth mindset. Because this activity is grounded in re ection, it is imperative that participants feel they are part of a safe, non-threatening community of learners prior to engaging in the Socratic Seminar.\n82 AVID Culturally Relevant Teaching: A Schoolwide Approach\n","3.3\nAcademic Mindsets\nEducator Objective\nEducators will learn how academic mindsets impact student learning.\nOverview\nFarrington (2013) suggested that “one of the best levers for increasing students’ perseverance and improving their academic behaviors is by supporting the development of academic mindsets. Students with positive academic mindsets work harder, engage in more productive academic behaviors, and persevere to overcome obstacles to success.” This activity will explore the four academic mindsets needed to deepen learning, so students become more competent learners both inside and outside of school.\nMaterials/Set-Up\n• Educator Resources:\n• 3.3a: Mindsets and Student Agency\n• 3.3b: Academic Mindsets Recording Sheet\nInstructional Steps\n• Group educators into small groups of four to six.\n• Give each group one of the following four quotes that they may hear from\ntheir students:\n• “I belong in this learning community.”\n• “I can change my intelligence and abilities through effort.” • “This work has value and purpose for me.”\n• “I can succeed.”\nIf more than four groups are present, quotes can be used more than once.\n• Ask each group to focus on their assigned quote and think about what this quote means in terms of a student who is developing as a learner. What is the student implying? What message should educators take away? What words might be used to describe this student?\n• Explain that each of these quotes is tied to an academic mindset. There are four academic mindsets that drive students’ motivations and effort.\n• Share the four academic mindsets and ask educators to determine the one that connects to their quote:\n• Sense of Belonging • Growth Mindset\n• Relevance\n• Self-Ef cacy\nEmpowering Student Voice: Transforming Educators 89\n","• Direct educators to read the Mindsets and Student Agency resource, and then use the Academic Mindsets Recording Sheet to detail connections for classroom instruction for each of the mindsets. They should also answer the culminating question at the bottom of the page: “Why is knowledge about mindsets important in a culturally relevant classroom?”\n• Ask educators to select one connection from their recording sheet that they will work on as their next step.\nExtension\n• To extend the learning, invite educators to learn more about academic mindsets by reading Camille Farrington’s (2013) white paper, “Academic Mindsets as a Critical Component of Deeper Learning” (http://www. hewlett.org/uploads/documents/Academic_Mindsets_as_a_Critical_ Component_of_Deeper_Learning_CAMILLE_FARRINGTON_April_20_2013. pdf).\n90 AVID Culturally Relevant Teaching: A Schoolwide Approach\n","CHAPTER FOUR\nEmpowering Student Voice Empowering Students\nVisit the AVID Culturally Relevant Teaching webpage on MYAVID for additional materials and resources.\n115\n","4.1\nMy Mindset\nStudent Objective\nk-3 4-6\nStudents will develop an understanding of the concepts of  xed and growth mindsets and begin to focus on developing growth-mindset thinking.\nOverview\nIn her book, Mindset: The New Psychology of Success, Carol Dweck’s (2006) research showed that intelligence is malleable, and teaching students about how the brain works, along with the concepts of  xed and growth mindsets, is the  rst step toward developing their own growth mindset. This activity involves three class periods, but educators may choose to complete it in two sessions.\nMaterials/Set-Up\n• Educator Resource:\n• 4.1a: Growth Mindset: What Can I Say to Myself? Example\n• Student Handouts:\n• 4.1b: My Brain\n• 4.1c: Mindset Scenarios\n• 4.1d: Growth Mindset: What Can I Say to Myself? • 4.1e: Growth Mindset: Frayer Model\n• 5x7” index cards, with either Agree or Disagree written on them (one pair for each student)\nInstructional Steps\nDay 1:\n• Conduct a pre-assessment to see what students already know about their brain and how it works. Distribute the My Brain handout on page 121 and direct students to draw a picture within the outline of the head, showing what they think their brains might look like. At the bottom of the page, students should write down all of the information that they already know about their brain.\n• Collect and review the student responses in order to give feedback the following day.\n• Tell students that you are going to read three sentences (from a Carol Dweck workshop on www.mindsetworks.com), and they should show if they agree or disagree with each of them. Students can use agree and disagree cards, raise or lower hands, or signal thumbs-up or thumbs- down to show their responses. This provides the educator with additional information about the current beliefs of their students.\n• Everyone can learn new things. (Growth-mindset belief)\n• Some kids are born smarter than others. (Fixed-mindset belief) • We can change how smart we are. (Growth-mindset belief)\nEmpowering Student Voice: Empowering Students 117\n","Day 2:\n• Give students feedback on the pre-assessments by sharing common themes that resulted.\n• Utilizing the research and work of Dweck (2006), introduce the concept of mindset and explain to students, with the following talking points, that there are two types of mindsets:  xed and growth.\n• A mindset is comprised of “beliefs about yourself and your most basic qualities.”\n• “In a  xed mindset, people believe that their basic qualities, like their intelligence or talent, are simply  xed traits. They spend their time documenting their intelligence or talent instead of developing them. They also believe that talent alone creates success— without effort.” Dweck’s research suggests that students who have adopted a  xed mindset have the belief that they are either “smart” or “dumb,” and there is no way to change this.\n• “In a growth mindset, people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work—brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment.” Dweck’s research suggests that students who embrace growth mindsets have the belief that they can learn more or become smarter if they work hard and persevere.\n• Distribute the Mindset Scenarios handout and ask students to work\nin pairs to categorize the scenarios into either  xed- or growth-mindset thinking. Students may cut the scenarios apart and group them or write them in a two-column chart—use whatever process works best.\n• Debrief by having students share their justi cations for how they grouped their words.\nDay 3:\n• Explain to students that in this classroom, they are going to work on developing growth mindsets.\n• Distribute the Growth Mindset: What Can I Say to Myself? handout and explain that the sentences on the left are examples of things that a person with a  xed mindset might say.\n• Utilizing the Growth Mindset: What Can I Say to Myself? Example resource, model with students how to change the  rst sentence on\nthe left (the  xed-mindset thinking) into a sentence that shows growth- mindset thinking and write it on the right. Ask students to share other ways that they might change it and why their changes are examples of growth-mindset thinking. Explain that there are many ways—not just one right answer—to change the original thinking into a growth-mindset statement.\n118 AVID Culturally Relevant Teaching: A Schoolwide Approach\n","• Direct students to pair up and work to complete the rest of the sentences together.\n• Students may put more than one response in the right-hand column.\n• After completing the right-hand column, have pairs group with another pair to form a quad. Within the quad, students should share their responses.\n• Add student responses and the growth-mindset scenarios to a Growth Mindset Wall.\n• Creating a space that displays words, phrases, quotes, visuals, and scenarios that relate to growth-mindset thinking provides a visual reminder for both the students and educator to think with a growth mindset.\n• Have students keep their completed handouts in their notebooks as a reminder and reference for using growth-mindset thinking.\n• As a summative activity, have students complete the Growth Mindset: Frayer Model handout by developing their own de nition of growth mindset, creating a visual representation for growth mindset, and sharing examples and non-examples of growth-mindset actions or thinking.\nExtension\n• To increase rigor, spend extended time teaching students about the brain and how it works. Advocates of fostering growth-mindset thinking, such as Carol Dweck, Zaretta Hammond, and Mary Cay Ricci, promote teaching students about the brain as a critical step in developing growth mindsets, as students must learn that their brain is malleable and can change and grow.
